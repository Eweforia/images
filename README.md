**GitHub Beginner Guide**
https://github.com/

First, you need to create a repository.
1. Go to GitHub and log in with your account.
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
3. Enter your choice of repository name.
4. Enter your choice of a description.
5. Select Public.
6. Click Create repository.

I created a repository named images.

Repositories are listed in the left pane on the Dashboard. You can also click the sandwich on the top left and see a list of repositories at the bottom.

**To upload a new image:**
1. Click the Add file button (to the left of the green Code button). Then click Upload files.
2. Drag/drop or copy/paste files from your hard drive or copy/paste from the clipboard. 
Github assigns every new file the name "image.png." (Any existing file named image.png will be overwritten.) 
3. Click the green Commit changes button at the bottom. 
Githug displays a list of files in the repository. *(I cannot figure out how to display thumbnails.)* The new image.png is listed.

**Immediately change the file's name.**

1. Click the new image to display it. 
2. Click the pencil icon on the upper right toolbar.

Github displays "Binary file content is not editable. But you can still rename or move it." Don't be alarmed.

3. Rename the file via the text box at the upper left and click the green Commit changes button on the right. Confirm the commit.

**To get a Direct link:**
1. In the repository, click on the image filename to display it. 
2. Right-click the image preview and select “Copy image address” or “Copy image URL” (the wording may vary by browser).

This gives you a direct link to the raw image file.
