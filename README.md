First, you need to create a repository.
1. Go to GitHub and log in with your account.
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
3. Enter your choice of repository name.
4. Enter your choice of a description.
5. Select Public.
6. Click Create repository.

Repositories are listed in the left pane on the Dashboard. You can also click the sandwich on the top left and see a list of repositories at the bottom.
I created a repository named images.

To upload a new image, click the Add file button (to the left of the green Code button). Then click Upload files.
You can drag files from your hard drive or copy/paste. 
Github assigns the name "image.png." (Any esxisting file named image.png will be overwritten.) 
Click the green Commit changes button at the bottom. Githug displays a list of files in the repository. (I cannot figure out how to display thumbnails.) The new image.png is listed.
Click the new image. Click the pencil icon on the right side.
